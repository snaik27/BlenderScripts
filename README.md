# BlenderScripts
<h3>Scripts with commits prior to 8.31.19 are written for Blender 2.79, all else written for Blender 2.8+ <br> </h3>

<h4> NOTE: If you use these, please look at any comments in the script. Generally they're as developer-friendly as I can make them, but just be careful so you're not unnecessarily frustrated. <br> </h4>

<h5> Just easier to back these up here </h5>
